  <br><h2>Celebrating Arsenal's French players and manager</h2>
  <br><p>adidas release limited edition Arsenal collection celebrating the historical link between famous French players and a manager who have written their names in the club's history books. Unveiled as this summer marks 20 years since the start of the famous Invincibles season, when the club went an entire league campaign without a defeat.</p>
  <img class="image" src="assets/img/adidas2.jpg" alt="image">
  <br><p>The special collection pays homage to the success that French players and manager Arsene Wenger brought in the late '90s and '00s. The range includes various items, including a hoodie, track bottoms, track top, t-shirt and stadium parka.</p>
  <img class="image" src="assets/img/adidas3.jpg" alt="image">
  <br><p>All the items feature a special tricolour, adidas three stripes, and gold branding. The stadium parka will be donned by the team when they travel to league games, including when they walk out against Manchester City tonight in the FA Cup 4th round.</p>
  <br><p>From players like Patrick Vieira, Robert Pires, Thierry Henry, Sylvain Wiltord, Gael Clichy, Pasqual Cygan and Jeremy Aliadiere - the French connection to the club has been strong, bringing silverware and success to the club.</p>

  <br><p>Jeremy Aliadiere, who played in the Invincibles season and currently works for Arsenal in an ambassador role, said: "During that period in the late 1990s and early 2000s, it was great to be part of the team at Arsenal. We had a lot of players from France, or French-speaking countries, and we were made to feel at home straight away by the other members of the squad."</p>

  <br><p>Aliadiere added, "That togetherness we had back then is something I see in this current team, and so it's great to celebrate the period I played in, at a time when it's a really enjoyable to be a Gooner. I think the range will be loved by supporters across the world, and it's a nice gesture to those particularly in France â€“ many of whom fell in love with the club during that period 20 years or so ago."</p>
