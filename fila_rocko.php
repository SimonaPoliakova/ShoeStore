  <br><p>Guess what, ‘90s kids? This year marks the 30th anniversary of Rocko’s Modern Life, and FILA has just the footwear to celebrate the beloved characters of O-Town.</p>
 
  <br><p>In collaboration with Paramount Consumer Products, FILA is launching a special collection of sneakers exclusively for fila.com, Foot Locker, and Champs Sports. Each shoe is adorned with familiar faces from the Nickelodeon cartoon, bringing the characters of Rocko, Heffer, and Filburt out of the ’90s and into your next trendy outfit.</p>
 
  <br><p>The FILA x Rocko’s Modern Life collection features three distinct styles. Each comes with Rocko’s Modern Life and FILA logos on the tongue, heel, upper liner, and sock liner. </p>

  <br><p>The Rocko x Renno style honors the lovable wallaby protagonist. Designed in a coral hue as a nod to Rocko’s footwear, these sneakers also include a vibrant graphic design mimicking the character’s colorful signature shirt. As the cherry on top, the sneakers are embellished with images of Rocko and his dog, Spunky. The Rocko x Renno sneakers are available for $100 or $90 for kids.</p>
 
  <br><p>The Heffer x F-13 design celebrates Rocko’s best friend, Heffer Wolfe. With hues of red, light yellow, and lavender, this sneaker also includes an image of the character himself on the FILA flag. The red and purple coloring pays homage to his trademark suspenders and red pants. The Heffer x F-13 style is available for $90 or $80 for kids.</p>

  <br><p>Finally, the Filburt x Original Fitness style plays on the characteristics of the turtle Filburt through its colorway and design. His turquoise skin and green shell with turquoise ovals are incorporated into the silhouette. His famous blue glasses appear on the heel, while an image of the character can be seen sitting on top of the FILA flag. The Filburt x Original Fitness shoes are available for $85 or $75 for kids.</p>
  
 <br> <p>Starting on Feb. 28, the entire collection of men’s and kid’s footwear will be available on champssports.com and Champs Sports locations, while the men’s footwear will also be available on fila.com, footlocker.com, and Foot Locker locations.</p>
